This is our second time being around finger lakes. Snowfall make here wear a white veil. 
We first visited the Women’s Rights Museum. It was really interesting how they compare 
Haudenosaunee women’s rights with those of white Europeans, and how Indigenous values 
influenced what happened here. 

There is a chapel next to the museum, and they have preserved the building’s original structure.

Mules seem to be an important part of the local culture here. It is interesting to learn that mules can live longer than horses and donkeys, 
while retaining the best characteristics of both. They also played an important role when people were exploring this land.
