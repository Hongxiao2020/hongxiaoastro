This is our second time being around finger lakes. Snowfall make here wear a white veil. 
We first visited the Women’s Rights Museum. It was really interesting how they compare 
Haudenosaunee women’s rights with those of white Europeans, and how Indigenous values 
influenced what happened here. 

There is a chapel next to the museum, and they have preserved the building’s original structure.



Mules seem to be an important part of the local culture here. It is interesting to learn that mules can live longer than horses and donkeys, 
while retaining the best characteristics of both. 



We went to Muranda for a cheese tasting. They make cheeses with different flavors, including grilled green onion, truffle, pepper, and sun-dried tomatoes. 
We chose the Dilly Girl and Red Rider for their strong flavors.


Then we headed to Knapp for a wine tasting. They make many different kinds of wine. 
We especially loved 
- the 2022 Seyval Blanc, 
- the 2022 Barrel-Aged Chardonnay, and 
- the 2022 Forte Bianco.
